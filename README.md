### Course Description:

This advanced unit introduces Machine Learning (ML) approaches, concepts and methods through direct examples, practical problem solving and core technical training for creative applications.

The unit explores a specific set of approaches for both interactive and offline Machine Learning using common tools and frameworks such as Tensorflow, Torch, Keras and TFlearn, or equivalent. Fundamental concepts such as classification, clustering and regression are developed through practical problem solving including gesture recognition and tracking, sound and image classification, and text processing. Problems such sequence matching using probabilistic and stochastic processes (MMs, HMMs) are explained explored, as are contemporary ML approaches including basic RNNs/LSTMs, CNNs, GANs, SEQ2SEQ, PIX2PIX, Word2Vec and other emerging methods.

* Understanding and applying advanced ML methods (Classification, Regression, Clustering, Sequence Matching)
* Building ML systems for problem solving (Gesture, Image, Sound and Text classification / tracking)
* ML systems for Creative Applications – image generation, sound generation

#### Grading: 

* Online testing: Students will complete a set of problem-solving assignments via online testing and video documentation of running code, which will be submitted for grading at the end of each session. (50%)  

* Final examination: Students will sit a final online written exam which will be 2 hours in duration. The exam comprises a 20 question multiple-choice test, and a series of three questions to test their knowledge of ML. Student’s will be asked to propose and describe appropriate solutions for given machine learning problems. (50%)
