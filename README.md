### Course Description:

This advanced unit introduces Machine Learning (ML) approaches, concepts and methods through direct examples, practical problem solving and core technical training for creative applications.

The unit explores a specific set of approaches for both interactive and offline Machine Learning using common tools and frameworks such as Tensorflow, Torch, Keras and TFlearn, or equivalent. Fundamental concepts such as classification, clustering and regression are developed through practical problem solving including gesture recognition and tracking, sound and image classification, and text processing. Problems such sequence matching using probabilistic and stochastic processes (MMs, HMMs) are explained explored, as are contemporary ML approaches including basic RNNs/LSTMs, CNNs, GANs, SEQ2SEQ, PIX2PIX, Word2Vec and other emerging methods.

* Understanding and applying advanced ML methods (Classification, Regression, Clustering, Sequence Matching)
* Building ML systems for problem solving (Gesture, Image, Sound and Text classification / tracking)
* ML systems for Creative Applications – image generation, sound generation

</p>

* **Topics:** Lecture showcases some cool examples of Machine Learning (in and outside of art context), concept of having a model and treating it as a black box in a processing pipeline. Practical section contains examples with coding up Linear Regression for a simple dataset of points.

#### Week 2 (24.4.) - Building blocks of NNs // Practicum: first models with Keras - [slides pdf](https://github.com/previtus/cci_exploring_machine_intelligence/blob/master/week02_basic-building-blocks/ml02_basic-building-blocks.pdf)

</p>

* **Topics:** Lecture explores the basic building blocks used when creating Neural Networks. Artificial Neurons, Neural Networks, connecting image data with Fully Connected NNs and finally training. In the practical session we create the neural network we studied about in the class (and show it's really simple to do so!) and train it on the MNIST dataset. We also show how to use (and as a bonus also how the hack) the trained model.

#### Week 3 - Convolutions, AlexNet, ImageNet // Practicum: using existing models - [slides pdf](https://github.com/previtus/cci_exploring_machine_intelligence/blob/master/week03_convolutional-nns/ml03_convolutional-nns.pdf)

</p>

* **Topics:** Lecture starts with illustration of overfitting, then explores Convolutional operation applied over images. We then use convolutions inside Neural Networks and introduce Convolutional Neural Networks and their general model architecture. We describe the functionally differentiated sections of the model such as feature extractor and classifier. We visualize convolutional kernels to bring in some intuitive understanding to networks using convolutions (for tasks of classification or image generation). In the practical session we use existing trained neural networks to label images. We also extract feature descriptors of images inside a dataset (CIFAR-10) navigate the latent space (for searching and tracking trajectories).

#### Week 4 - Beyond classification, Generative models - VAE
